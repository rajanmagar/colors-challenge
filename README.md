# colors-challenge

The intent of this challenge is to explore general system design, along with
approaches to code extensibility. While a simple challenge, we wish to stress that
extensibility is important, please think about how easy it would be for others to take
your work and add new elements to it.

## Short Description

- Build a back-end to generate color swatches via an API in various color spaces.
- Build a front-end to consume the back-end API and render the color swatches.
- Maintain a focus on extensibility in your code.
